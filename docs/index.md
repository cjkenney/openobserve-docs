OpenObserve and [OpenObserve Cloud](https://observe.openobserve.ai) make achieving your application observability goals super easy. Either with self hosted OpenObserve or [OpenObserve Cloud](https://observe.openobserve.ai) it takes under 2 minutes to get up and running.

With logs, metrics and traces together in a single system that works at petabyte scale you get full observability for your applications. We are still early in our development with logs being ready for productiion use, while metrics and traces still under development and will be available soon.

Beautiful Embedded UI, Dashboards, Alerting, Stateless nodes, 140x lower storage costs and more will make it easy to resolve your application issues faster and manage your day 2 operations super easy.
